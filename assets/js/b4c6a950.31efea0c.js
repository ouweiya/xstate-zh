One of the prime examples in this area is robotic arms, traditionally used to aid and extend the reach of humans in manufacturing, surgery, and space exploration. Each of these use cases require some way of programming and controlling the arm to perform their dedicated task, usually with proprietary software developed by the manufacturer.
