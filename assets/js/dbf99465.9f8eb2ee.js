It helps pet owners book, reschedule, and cancel appointments for their pets. The system has different states that represent different stages of the booking process. The initial state is "Idle", which means the system is waiting for a pet owner to start the booking process. When a pet owner wants to book an appointment, they trigger the "book" event. This transitions the system to the "Appointment Booked" state, indicating that an appointment has been successfully booked. From the "Appointment Booked" state, the pet owner can choose to reschedule or cancel the appointment. If they choose to reschedule, the system transitions to the "Appointment Rescheduled" state, indicating that the appointment has been rescheduled to a new time. If they choose to cancel, the system transitions to the "Appointment Canceled" state, indicating that the appointment has been canceled. Additionally, the system can send a reminder to the pet owner 24 hours before the appointment from the "Appointment Booked" or "Appointment Rescheduled" states. This transitions the system to the "Reminder Sent" state. From the "Reminder Sent" state, if the pet owner wants to book a new appointment, they can trigger the "book" event, which transitions the system back to the "Appointment Booked" state. Each state has associated actions that are performed when transitioning to that state. These actions include notifying the pet owner about the booking, rescheduling, cancellation, or sending a reminder.
